Take away
- Software process models
- A structered set of activities required to develop a software system.
- In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
- The waterfall model is mostly used for large systems engineering projects where a system is developed.
- Reuse-oriented Software Engineering
- Reuse is now the standard approach for building many types of business system.
- Process activities 
- Requirements engineering process
- Is it technically and financially feasible to build the system?
- Software Validation
- Involves checking and review processes and system testing.
- Testing is the most commonly used V & V activity.
- System testing
- Testing of the system as a whole. Testing of emergent properties is particularly important.
- Software Evolution
- Software is inherently flexible and change.
- Coping with change
- Change is inevitable in all larger projects. 
- Software Prototyping
- Benefits of Prototyping
- Improved system usability
- Improved design quality.
- Reduced development effort.
- Incremental Delivery
- Boehm's Spiral Model
- Spiral Model Sectors
- Objective Setting
- Risk assessment and reduction
- Development and validation
- Planning
- The Rational Unified Process
- Static workflows in the Rational Unified Process.
- Business Modelling 
- Requirements
- Analysis and design 
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Being a software engineer will only increase our value and increase our chances to get a good job offer and a good payment. There are many software engineers 
comparing to 10 years ago which means competition is even more difficult. So we have to improve our talents.

Study guide
- Software process - A structured set of activities required to develop a software system, specification, design and implementation, validation and evolution.
- Process description - Products, roles, pre and post conditions.
- Types of software processes - plan driven andd agile processes ( dependent on software specification).
- The water fall model phases - requirements definition, system and software design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing, operation and maintainance.
- Reuse oriented software engineering phases - requirement specifications, component analysis, requirement modifications, system design reuse, development and integration, system validation.
- Software specification - process to identify what the services and constrains for a systems operation and developmet. Includes - system feasibility study, requiremnt expectations and analysis, requirement specifications, requirement validation. 
The requirement engineering process - feasibility study -> feasibility report, requiremnt expectations and analysis -> systems models, requirement specifications -> user and system requirement, requirement validation -> requirements document.
- Software design and implemetation - process of converting the system specification into exucutable systems. Includes - software design and implementation.
Design inputs - platform information, requirement specification and data specification.
Design activities - architectural design, interface design, component design and database design.
Design output - system architecture, database specification, interface specification and component specification.
- Software validation - intends to show that a system confirm sto its specifications and meets the requirement of the system customer, mostly done by tetsting.
Sytem testing involves executing the system with tests cases that are derived from specification of real data to be processed by the system.
Testing phases - development or component testing, system testing and acceptance testing.
- Software evolution - systems can change dependent on the change in a systems requirements.
- Software prototyping - initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts andd try out design options.
- The rational unified process - This is the approach to software development that implements architectural, object based, component based approach to system development ( mordern approach ).
