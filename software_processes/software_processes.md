Study guide
- Software process - A structured set of activities required to develop a software system, specification, design and implementation, validation and evolution.
- Process description - Products, roles, pre and post conditions.
- Types of software processes - plan driven andd agile processes ( dependent on software specification).
- The water fall model phases - requirements definition, system and software design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing, operation and maintainance.
- Reuse oriented software engineering phases - requirement specifications, component analysis, requirement modifications, system design reuse, development and integration, system validation.
- Software specification - process to identify what the services and constrains for a systems operation and developmet. Includes - system feasibility study, requiremnt expectations and analysis, requirement specifications, requirement validation. 
The requirement engineering process - feasibility study -> feasibility report, requiremnt expectations and analysis -> systems models, requirement specifications -> user and system requirement, requirement validation -> requirements document.
- Software design and implemetation - process of converting the system specification into exucutable systems. Includes - software design and implementation.
Design inputs - platform information, requirement specification and data specification.
Design activities - architectural design, interface design, component design and database design.
Design output - system architecture, database specification, interface specification and component specification.
- Software validation - intends to show that a system confirm sto its specifications and meets the requirement of the system customer, mostly done by tetsting.
Sytem testing involves executing the system with tests cases that are derived from specification of real data to be processed by the system.
Testing phases - development or component testing, system testing and acceptance testing.
- Software evolution - systems can change dependent on the change in a systems requirements.
- Software prototyping - initial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts andd try out design options.
- The rational unified process - This is the approach to software development that implements architectural, object based, component based approach to system development ( mordern approach ).
