Study guide
- Software process activity includes software specification, software development, software validation and software evolution ( software life-cycle ).
- Good software should have the following characteristics maintainability, dependability, security, efficiency, acceptability at the very least.
- Types of applications include stand alone applications ( example is a private bussiness inventory management system ), intaractive based applications ( example is web based applications ),
embedded control system ( example are hardware sysmtem programs ), batch processing systems ( examples large scale computing systems ), systems for modelling and stimulations.
- Software re-use is very important, re-using software during development is critical.
- Software engineer ethics includes the following confidentiality, competence, intellectual properties right, computer misuse
